        <h3>For when you need a high-fiber start to your day!</h3>
            <p>I absolutely love eating eggs in the morning; I also like eating guacamole, and by extension, avocadoes every chance that I get. So, why not combine the two?</p>

            <p>This recipe is one of my favorite to make, whenever I have the time or energy to make one in the morning. This fiber-filled, protein-filled breakfast item is enough to keep a person full until lunch time!</p>

                <li>2 whole eggs</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper, red pepper to taste</li>

        <h2>Step-By-Step Guide</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Slice avocado in half down the middle, to the pit in the middle, then remove the seed.</li>
                <li>Crack open 1 egg into a container, being careful not to break the yolk as it comes out.</li>
                <li>Using a spoon, carefully scoop the egg yolk out of the egg whites, and scoop the egg yolks into the avocado pit. Fill in any empty space within the pit with the leftover egg whites.</li>
                <li>Lightly season the avocadoes with the salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place the avocadoes halves in an oven or airfryer for 12-15 minutes, depending on how done you would like the eggs to be.</li>
                <li>Season the avocado halves with any remaining salt and pepper, and garnish with parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
